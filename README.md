# Predicting Educational Outcomes Using Machine Learning

I built a predictive model in Python on categorical weights of educational features within a dataset containing 594 NYC middle schools. Using a variety of machine learning algorithms such as PCA, I worked to determine categorical weights of educational features' expected contribution to educational attainment and outcomes. Currently, I am working on designing and implementing different models, such as 5-NN and higher order regressions, to optimize predictions considering simulated several realized datasets.
